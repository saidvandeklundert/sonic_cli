    used: memory used, calculated differently depending on the platform and designed for informational purposes only. total - free does not necessarily match used.

    inactive (UNIX): memory that is marked as not used.

    cached (Linux, BSD): cache for various things.
    shared (Linux, BSD): memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes.
